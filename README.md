## About
### ReactJS, Express, NodeJS, MongoDB
<hr>
The core of this assignment is to create an mini inventory app where the user can create, read, update, and delete data.

### Design
I wanted to create an inventory system based off of items you would see in a video game. I wanted those items to be influenced by 
RNG and then the user would be able to update the items name, quality, description, image, stats, and special text. 

### Code Backend
<hr>

#### testAPI.js


## Note about Deployment

Due to recent changes at heroku and limited space on railway, unable to show off project. I will figure out a different way to deploy the project.
For now, if you would like to view the project, you can clone and run 'npm start' at the root of the project and you will be able to view the project
at http://localhost:3000/.
